Modern day social media is plagued with ads and people sending unsolicited messages to strangers due to the ease of doing so via bots and automation. We feel that it is unfair that you have to waste your precious attention on spam and unwanted messages.

Ad services such as Google Ad sense helps you to monetize your attention to a certain degree, but what if we could democratize this whole process?

There are existing solutions out there to do exactly this, such as the Brave browser, but there has not been one in the area of text messaging.
