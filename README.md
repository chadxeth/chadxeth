Modern day social media is plagued with ads and people sending unsolicited messages to strangers due to the ease of doing so via bots and automation. We feel that it is unfair that you have to waste your precious attention on spam and unwanted messages.

Ad services such as Google Ad sense helps you to monetize your attention to a certain degree, but what if we could democratize this whole process?

There are existing solutions out there to do exactly this, such as the Brave browser, but there has not been one in the area of text messaging.

### BluebirdSwap - On-chain Fractionalised NFT Options Trading  (ETHDenver #BUIDLathon 2023)
### üèÜ The Graph ‚Äî Best New Subgraph(s)
![BluebirdSwap](Logo.png)
NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have become increasingly popular in recent years as a way to represent unique digital assets such as artwork, music, and video game items. However, high-value NFTs can be expensive and illiquid, making it difficult for smaller investors to gain exposure to the market.

With BluebirdSwap, users can buy and sell fractional ownership of NFTs, which makes it possible for smaller investors to participate in the market. This allows users to buy a share of a valuable NFT without having to pay the entire price upfront. Fractional ownership also allows investors to diversify their portfolios by owning a stake in multiple NFTs. BluebirdSwap provides a new way to speculate on the value of these assets. This is not possible on OpenSea or other NFT marketplaces, which only support direct trading of NFTs.

In addition to fractionalized NFTs, BluebirdSwap also offers an options trading platform for NFTs. Users can buy calls or puts on fractionalized NFTs, which allows them to potentially profit from price movements without having to buy the entire asset. This provides flexibility and risk management for investors who may not want to take on the full risk of owning an entire NFT. The premium for the options contracts is paid in the specific fractionalized NFT tokens.

Multinate is a cross-chain donation aggregator designed to streamline charitable fundraising by enabling donors from multiple blockchain ecosystems to contribute in the ERC-20 token of their choice. Our platform simplifies the donation process, enhances transparency, and empowers charities to withdraw the raised funds in USDC, facilitating the efficient allocation of resources.

Key Features:

Snapshot.org Integration: Multinate utilizes Snapshot.org to initiate fundraising campaigns, providing a preliminary assessment of a charity's legitimacy. Charities submit proposals on our dedicated Multinate space, and these proposals must garner more votes in favor than against to pass.

Gnosis Safe Account and Optimism's AttestationStation: Once the proposal is approved, the platform automatically creates a campaign through a Gnosis Safe account. At this stage, our system connects to Optimism's AttestationStation contract to ensure that the charity meets the minimum attestation score, which is based on four attested criteria from a trusted third party.

Multi-Chain Support: Multinate supports donations from various blockchain ecosystems, including Scroll Alpha, Optimism Mainnet, and Gnosis Mainnet. This broad compatibility enables donors to contribute using their preferred blockchain and token, making it easier than ever to support charitable causes.

USDC Withdrawals: Charities can efficiently access the funds raised through our platform by withdrawing them in USDC, ensuring a seamless and straightforward process from campaign initiation to fund allocation.
